### Create a Scroll-Ready Product Animation with Google AI

Welcome\! Creating a professional product animation for a website might seem complex, but with the power of modern AI, it's more accessible than ever. This guide will walk you through creating the core asset for a scroll-based web animation from scratch, using a simple, two-tool workflow. You won't need any prior animation experience—just a product idea and a few minutes.The final output of this tutorial won't be a simple video file. Instead, you'll have a numbered sequence of images, the professional standard for high-performance web animations. This asset is ready to be handed off to a web developer or used in a tool like Google Anti-Gravity to create an interactive, scroll-based experience.We'll be using two powerful and free tools from Google Labs:

* **Google Whisk:**  Our AI-powered image generator, perfect for crafting the beautiful start and end points of our animation.  
* **Google Flow:**  Our animation tool, which we'll use to generate a short video that serves as the perfect source for a web-ready image sequence.Let's get started\!

#### 1\. The Core Concept: The Two-Frame Animation Strategy

The fundamental strategy for this process is surprisingly simple. We're not animating every single detail by hand. Instead, we'll create just two key images: a  **"start frame"**  (the initial state of your product) and an  **"end frame"**  (the final state of your animation). The AI in Google Flow will then intelligently generate all the motion and transitions needed to get from the start to the end.This method is ideal for creating smooth, controllable animations for websites. We'll generate a short video that we will then convert into a sequence of still images, which allows web developers to trigger the animation as a user scrolls.To make this crystal clear, here are a few examples of how this start-to-end concept works for different products.| Start Frame Example | End Frame Example || \------ | \------ || A perfectly assembled wireless mouse, sitting on a clean, dark background. | The same mouse, with its components floating apart in a cinematic "exploded view." || A pristine cup of iced matcha coffee, perfectly still. | The same cup, but with ice cubes and liquid splashes frozen in mid-air around it. || A sleek, modern keyboard shown from a front-on angle. | The same keyboard, but viewed from a slightly different perspective, as if zoomed out. |  
Now that you understand the basic idea, let's create the two images you'll need.

#### 2\. Step 1: Crafting Your Images with Google Whisk

Our first task is to generate the high-quality start and end frames for our animation using Google Whisk.

##### 2.1. Accessing Whisk

First, navigate to Google Labs in your browser and open the  **Google Whisk**  tool. You will need a Google account to log in and use the service.

##### 2.2. Generating the 'Start Frame'

This image will be the very first thing your audience sees. It should be a clean, clear shot of your product in its assembled or "at rest" state.

1. **Locate the Prompt Box:**  On the left side of the Whisk interface, you'll find a prompt box labeled  **‘subject’** .  
2. **Write Your Prompt:**  In the subject box, write a clear, descriptive prompt for your product's initial state. Be specific but concise. For example: a picture of an camera  
3. **Generate and Select:**  Click the 'Generate' button and review the images Whisk creates. It will likely give you a few options to choose from.  
4. **Download and Rename:**  Once you're happy with an image, download it to your computer. For clarity, immediately rename the file to start-frame.jpg. This precise naming makes it easy to identify and upload the correct images in Google Flow's interface, which is designed for this start-to-end workflow.

##### 2.3. Generating the 'End Frame'

Now, let's create the second image, which represents the final moment of your animation.

1. **Define the Final State:**  Think about how you want the animation to conclude. Do you want the product to deconstruct? Do you want ingredients to splash into it? Do you want it to rotate?  
2. **Adjust Your Prompt:**  Modify your previous prompt to describe this new, final state. For our camera example, a good "exploded view" prompt would be: an exploded view of the camera, with its components floating apart cinematically  
3. **Iterate for Perfection:**  The AI might not get it perfect on the first try. Don't be afraid to adjust your prompt and generate again. As the experts advise:  *"If the result isn't quite right, regenerate it and tweak the prompt again. Even small changes in the prompt can make a big difference here."*  
4. **Download and Rename:**  When you have an image you're satisfied with, download it and rename the file end-frame.jpg.With your two static frames ready, it's time to bring them to life.

#### 3\. Step 2: Bringing Your Images to Life with Google Flow

Now we'll use Google Flow to animate the transition between your start and end frames, creating the source video for our final asset.

##### 3.1. Setting Up Your Animation Project

Getting started in Google Flow is quick and straightforward.

1. Navigate to and open the  **Google Flow**  tool.  
2. Click  **'New Project'** .  
3. From the options that appear, select  **'frames to video'** . This tells Flow that you'll be providing images to animate.

##### 3.2. Uploading Your Frames

You'll see two plus icons, one for each frame of your animation.

1. Click the first plus icon and upload your start-frame.jpg.  
2. Click the second plus icon and upload your end-frame.jpg.

##### 3.3. Prompting the Animation

In Flow, the prompt isn't about what the product  *is* , but about the  *motion and feeling*  of the transition between the two frames you uploaded. Describe how the animation should behave.Here are a few distinct prompt examples to give you ideas:

* create me a smooth 360-degree rotating animation  
* A smooth, cinematic transition from the assembled product to the exploded view.  
* A premium cinematic feel with smooth movement and a subtle camera push.

##### 3.4. Generating and Finalizing Your Video

You're just one click away from your animation.

1. **Generate:**  Click the 'Generate' or 'Submit' button to start the animation process.  
2. **Review and Refine:**  Once the video is ready, play it to ensure the motion feels "clean and natural." If the animation feels "too aggressive or too flat," simply adjust your prompt slightly and regenerate it.  
3. **Download:**  When you're happy with the result, download the final video. If you see an option to download an  **"upscaled version,"**  choose it—this will give you a higher-quality file.Now that you have your source video, it's time for the final, crucial step: converting it into a web-ready asset.

#### 4\. Step 3: Preparing Your Animation for the Web

This final step is the most important part of the process. We don't add the video file directly to a website because it can cause major performance issues and make the site feel laggy. Instead, we convert the video into an  **image sequence** . This gives web developers frame-by-frame control, allowing for the super-smooth, scroll-based animations you see on high-end product websites.

1. **Find a Converter:**  Navigate to an online "video to JPG" converter. A reliable and commonly used tool for this is easygif.com, which has a "Video to JPG" feature.  
2. **Upload Your Video:**  Upload the video file you just downloaded from Google Flow.  
3. **Choose Your Format:**  Select  **JPG**  as the output format. While other formats like WEBP exist, JPG is universally supported and works perfectly for this use case.  
4. **Set the Frame Rate:**  If the tool allows, set the frame rate. A good target is between  **29 to 30 frames per second (fps)**  to ensure a smooth playback on the website.  
5. **Convert and Download:**  Run the conversion. The tool will process your video and break it down into dozens or even hundreds of sequentially numbered images. Download the result, which will typically be a ZIP file containing all the frames.Congratulations\! You've successfully created a professional, web-ready image sequence. This folder of numbered images is the final asset—a powerful component ready to be used to build a stunning, interactive web experience.
